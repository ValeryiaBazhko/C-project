## Levenshtein Distance algorithm (Similarity Search)

- Helps find books even if there are minor typos in the search

- Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences
  
- The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other

- If a book title has a Levenshtein distance â‰¤ 3 from the search query, it is considered a match
